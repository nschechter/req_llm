              "text": "Chapter 1: The Whispering Map\n\nMira Calder did not pretend she could control the weather, only that she could read it. The harbor of Gaelport—the city carved into white limestone cliffs that watched over the Sea of Glass—was a choir of gulls and rigging and the dull, patient murmur of tides. It was in this chorus that Mira learned to listen for something more delicate: lines of a map that breathed.\n\nHer studio was a small room above a lace of market stalls, where she laid out vellum and ink the color of new rain. The atlas she kept at the center seemed to shimmer when a warm breeze found its way between the shutters, as if the pages themselves remembered where they had traveled and where they longed to go again. Some maps showed you places; Mira’s maps sang of paths. Tiny rivers glowed faintly with a pale blue, not water but memory—threads of routes dragons might have taken when they slept in the sky.\n\nOn the morning the courier arrived, Mira was tracing a sea-lane that stitched Gaelport to the far eastern coast, a line that would become a spine through which future maps could grow. The courier—a lean man with four-days’ beard and a coat the color of slate—pulled a sealed parchment from his pack and handed it to her without ceremony.\n\n“From the Guild of Cartographers,” he said, voice steady as a compass needle. “A commission. It’s time you came closer to the edge of the world, Miss Calder.”\n\nHer heart gave a quiet, skeptical jump. People often spoke of the edge of the world as if it were a cliff, but in Mira’s experience the edge was more a rumor—a line drawn in ink that drifted when you blinked. She pried the seal and found a single request, written in careful strokes that suggested a practiced hand rather than a fan of a bookish wish.\n\n“Chart the northern gradients beyond the Ember Gate. Return before the season of ash thickens the sky.” The signature was not a name but a symbol: a looped dragon’s tail encircling a star. The Guild did not sign with names when a place could do the talking for them.\n\nShe turned the parchment over and found a second note, tucked in at the back like a forgotten memory. It was not from the Guild but from someone who claimed to have known the lines Mira traced in her sleep. It read: Listen for the whispers of stone. They know the old routes still.\n\nThe message was not a warning, exactly. It was a door—one Mira had trained most of her life to open with nerve and patience.\n\nThat evening, as the sun bled orange along the Sea of Glass, Mira packed a light bag. Maps, inks, a set of small compasses, and a peculiar little object she kept tucked in her coat: a bronze pendant",
