            "reasoning_content": "\nFirst, the user asked to solve 12*7 and show my internal thinking briefly. So, I need to multiply 12 by 7.\n\nI know that multiplication is repeated addition. So, 12 times 7 means adding 12 seven times. Let me write that down mentally: 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12.\n\nNow, to make it easier, I can break it down. I recall that 12 is 10 + 2, so I can multiply 10 by 7 and 2 by 7 separately, then add them together.\n\nSo, 10 times 7 is 70. That's straightforward because 10*7=70.\n\nThen, 2 times 7 is 14.\n\nNow, add those two results: 70 + 14.\n\n70 + 10 is 80, plus 4 more is 84. So, 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nI can also think in terms of the multiplication table. I know that 12 times 7 should be 84 because I've memorized that, but since I need to show internal thinking, I should demonstrate the process.\n\nAnother way is to use the distributive property. For example, 12 * 7 = (10 + 2) * 7 = 10*7 + 2*7 = 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nOr, I could do it vertically, like in column multiplication.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n  12\n\nx  7\n\nFirst, multiply 2 by 7, which is 14. Write down the 4, carry over the 1.\n\nThen, multiply 1 (which is 10) by 7, which is 70, plus the carry-over 1, so 71. But since it's tens place, it's actually 70 + 10? No.\n\nIn vertical multiplication:\n\n  12\n\nx  7\n\nStep 1: Multiply the units digit: 2 * 7 = 14. Write down 4 in the units place, carry over 1 to the tens place.\n\nStep 2: Multiply the tens digit: 1 * 7 = 7. But since we carried over 1, it's 7 + 1 = 8. So, write 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, it's 84.\n\nSince it's a single-digit multiplier, it's straightforward.\n\nI can also think of 12*7 as 12* (10 - 3) but that might be more complicated. 12*10 = 120, minus 12*3=36, so 120 - 36 = 84. That works too, but it's unnecessary for this case since 7 is small.\n\nThe simplest way is probably the distributive property with 10 and 2.\n\nSince the user said \"brief,\" I should keep it concise.\n\nSo, my internal thinking: I recognize that 12 times 7 can be computed by breaking 12 into 10 and 2. Multiply 10 by 7 to get 70, and 2 by 7 to get 14. Then add 70 and 14 to get 84.\n\nI could also say that I know from memory that 12*7=84, but to show thinking, I should include the steps.\n\nThe user said \"show your internal thinking (brief)\", so I need to present it in a way that reflects my thought process.\n\nFinally, the answer is 84.\n\nNow, for the response: I should state the answer and then briefly describe the thinking.\n\nFor example: \"The product of 12 and 7 is 84. To find this, I broke 12 into 10 and 2, multiplied each by 7 (10*7=70, 2*7=14), and then added the results (70+14=84).\"\n\nThat seems brief and clear.\n\nIf I want to be even briefer: \"I computed 12*7 as (10+2)*7 = 70 + 14 = 84.\"\n\nI think that's fine.",
