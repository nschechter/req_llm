            "reasoning_content": "I need to solve 12 times 7. Let me think about how to approach this. I know that multiplication is repeated addition, so 12 times 7 means adding 12 seven times. But adding 12 seven times might take a while, so there must be a quicker way.\n\nI remember that breaking down numbers can make multiplication easier. For example, 12 can be split into 10 and 2. So, if I do 10 times 7 and then 2 times 7, I can add those results together. That should work because of the distributive property: a*(b + c) = a*b + a*c. Here, it's like 7*(10 + 2) = 7*10 + 7*2.\n\nLet me calculate each part. First, 10 times 7 is 70. Then, 2 times 7 is 14. Now, adding those together: 70 plus 14. 70 plus 10 is 80, and then plus 4 more is 84. So, 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nI could also think about it in terms of known facts. I know that 6 times 7 is 42, so doubling that would give me 12 times 7. Since 12 is twice 6, multiplying by 12 should be twice multiplying by 6. So, 42 times 2 is 84. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nAnother way is to use the standard algorithm for multiplication. Writing it out:\n\n  12\nx  7\n----\nFirst, multiply 7 by 2, which is 14. Write down 4 and carry over 1. Then, multiply 7 by 1, which is 7, plus the carried-over 1 is 8. So, putting it together, it's 84.\n\nAll these methods lead to the same answer, so I'm confident that 12 times 7 is 84.",
