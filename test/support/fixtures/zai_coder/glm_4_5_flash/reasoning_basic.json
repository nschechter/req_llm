            "reasoning_content": "\nFirst, the user asked to solve 12 times 7. That's multiplication. I need to find the product of 12 and 7.\n\nI should show my internal thinking briefly. That means I need to explain how I'm getting to the answer in a concise way.\n\nLet me recall multiplication facts. I know that 10 times 7 is 70, and 2 times 7 is 14. Since 12 is 10 plus 2, I can multiply each part separately and then add them together.\n\nSo, 12 * 7 = (10 + 2) * 7 = 10*7 + 2*7.\n\n10*7 is 70.\n\n2*7 is 14.\n\nThen, 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nI can also think of it as adding 7 twelve times: 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7. But that might take longer, and the user asked for brief thinking, so the first way is better.\n\nAnother way is to use the distributive property, which is what I did.\n\nI could think of 12*7 as 7*12, same thing.\n\nOr, I know that 12*5 is 60, but that might not help directly. 7 is not 5, so probably not efficient.\n\nStandard multiplication: 12 times 7. 2 times 7 is 14, write down 4, carry over 1. Then 1 times 7 is 7, plus the carry-over 1 is 8, so 84. That's the algorithm way.\n\nBut since the user said \"internal thinking,\" I should explain it in words.\n\nLet me draft a brief explanation.\n\nInternal thinking:\n\nI break down 12 into 10 and 2. Then, 10*7=70, and 2*7=14. Adding those together, 70+14=84.\n\nThat's concise.\n\nI could say: I recall that 12 times 7 is 84 from memory, but I should show the process, not just state it.\n\nThe user said \"show your internal thinking,\" so demonstrating the calculation is better.\n\nAnother thought: in terms of groups. 12 groups of 7 objects each. But that might be verbose.\n\nI think the first method is fine.\n\nSo, for the response:\n\nFirst, I'll state the answer clearly.\n\nThen, explain the brief internal thinking.\n\nResponse structure:\n\n- Answer: 84\n\n- Internal thinking: I multiplied 10 by 7 to get 70, and 2 by 7 to get 14, then added 70 and 14 to get 84.\n\nThat should be good.\n\nTo make it even shorter: I used the distributive property: (10 + 2) * 7 = 10*7 + 2*7 = 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nBut since it's internal thinking, perhaps more conversational.\n\nThe user said \"brief,\" so keep it short.\n\nFinal internal thinking: I thought of 12 as 10 + 2, multiplied each by 7, and summed the results.\n\nYes.",
