I should acknowledge their greeting in a way that's both welcoming and open-ended.\n\nI want to create a positive first impression while making it clear that I'm here to help. The response should be approachable yet professional, inviting them to share what's on their mind.\n\nPerhaps I could start with a similar friendly greeting, then express my willingness to assist. It would be good to keep the door open for any type of question or conversation they might want to have.\n\nI should avoid being too formal or too casual - striking that balance where I sound helpful and accessible. The goal is to make them feel comfortable sharing what they need help with.\n\nLet me craft a response that's warm, welcoming, and clearly indicates my readiness to assist with whatever they might need.",
