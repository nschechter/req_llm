            "content": "\n12 * 7 = 84\n\n**Internal Thinking:**\nTo make the multiplication easier, I'll break the number 12 down into a 10 and a 2.\n\n1.  First, I'll multiply the easy part: **10 * 7 = 70**.\n2.  Next, I'll multiply the remaining part: **2 * 7 = 14**.\n3.  Finally, I'll add those two results together: **70 + 14 = 84**.",
            "reasoning_content": "\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user wants me to solve the multiplication problem `12 * 7`. The key part is \"show your internal thinking (brief)\". This means I need to go beyond just giving the answer and explain *how* I got it. The \"brief\" part is important - I shouldn't write a novel about number theory, just a concise explanation of the process.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming & Method Selection:** How can I solve 12 * 7?\n    *   **Standard Multiplication Algorithm (the \"school\" method):**\n        ```\n          12\n        x  7\n        ----\n         84\n        ```\n        This works. The thinking is: 7 * 2 is 14. Write down the 4, carry the 1. Then 7 * 1 is 7. Add the carried 1 to get 8. The result is 84. This is a solid, common method. It's a good candidate for the explanation.\n\n    *   **Decomposition/Breaking it Down (Distributive Property):** This is often how people do mental math. 12 can be broken down into 10 + 2.\n        *   So, `12 * 7` is the same as `(10 + 2) * 7`.\n        *   Distribute the 7: `(10 * 7) + (2 * 7)`.\n        *   Solve the easier parts: `70 + 14`.\n        *   Combine them: `84`.\n        This method is very intuitive and easy to explain. It's a great way to show the \"internal thinking\" because it mimics how a human might break the problem down into simpler chunks.\n\n    *   **Repeated Addition:** I could add 7 twelve times (or 12 seven times).\n        *   `7 + 7 + 7 + ...` (12 times). This is conceptually correct what multiplication *is*, but it's inefficient and not very \"brief\" to write out. I'll discard this as a primary explanation, though it's the fundamental concept.\n\n3.  **Choosing the Best Method for the Explanation:**\n    *   The \"school method\" is good, but explaining \"carry the one\" might feel a bit rote. It's a procedural explanation.\n    *   The \"decomposition\" method is excellent. It shows the logic behind the numbers and is very clear. It demonstrates an understanding of the distributive property, which is a core mathematical concept. This feels more like \"internal thinking.\"\n\n4.  **Structuring the Answer:** I'll follow a clear structure to meet the user's request.\n    *   **State the Answer First:** Give the final result right away. This is good practice. The user wants the answer, the explanation is secondary. `12 * 7 = 84`.\n    *   **Internal Thinking Section:** Create a clear heading like \"Internal Thinking:\" or something similar.\n    *   **Explain the Chosen Method:** I'll use the decomposition method. I'll write it out step-by-step.\n        1.  I need to calculate 12 times 7.\n        2.  It's easier to break 12 into 10 and 2.\n        3.  Calculate 10 * 7, which is 70.\n        4.  Calculate 2 * 7, which is 14.\n        5.  Add those two results together: 70 + 14.\n        6.  70 + 10 is 80, and 80 + 4 is 84.\n        7.  So, the final answer is 84.\n    *   **Refine the Language:** Make sure the language is simple, direct, and fits the \"brief\" requirement. I can combine some steps.\n\n5.  **Final Polish:** Read through the planned response.\n    *   **Answer:** 12 * 7 = 84. (Clear and direct)\n    *   **Internal Thinking:** I'll use the decomposition method. It's often faster to do mentally.\n        *   Break 12 down into 10 + 2.\n        *   Multiply each part by 7: `(10 * 7) + (2 * 7)`.\n        *   This gives `70 + 14`.\n        *   Add them together: `84`.\n    This is concise, easy to follow, and accurately represents a common mental math strategy. It perfectly fulfills the \"show your internal thinking (brief)\" part of the prompt. I'll format it nicely for the final output.",
