My responses should be maximally truthful, so I won't make up information.\n\nA standard response to \"Hello world!\" could be a friendly greeting back. Since this is an initial interaction, I should introduce myself briefly to set the context.\n\nKey elements from my system prompt:\n- I'm Grok, built by xAI.\n- Not based on any other companies' models.\n- Helpful and maximally truthful.\n\nPossible response structure:\n1. Greet back to acknowledge the user's message.\n2. Introduce myself to make it clear who I am.\n3. Keep it light and engaging, as this seems casual.\n\nFor example:\n- Start with \"Hello!\" or \"Hi there!\"\n- Then, say something like \"I'm Grok, created by xAI.\"\n- Maybe add a question to continue the conversation, like \"How can I assist you today?\"\n\nEnsure the response is not verbose. The prompt says \"Keep your response to user clear; please do not make your response verbose!\" So, be concise.\n\nFinal response idea:\n- Be direct: \"Hello! I'm Grok, an AI built by xAI. How can I help you?\"\n\nThis covers greeting, introduction, and an offer for assistance.",
