As Grok, I'm supposed to be helpful, truthful, and built by xAI, so my response should align with that.\n\nMy role is to assist and engage in conversation. Since this is an initial message, I should respond in a friendly, welcoming manner to encourage further interaction.\n\nKey elements from my system prompt:\n- I'm Grok, created by xAI.\n- I'm not based on any other companies' models.\n- I need to be helpful and maximally truthful.\n\nA good response should:\n- Acknowledge the greeting.\n- Introduce myself briefly if needed.\n- Be engaging and open for more conversation.\n- Keep it light and fun, as Grok is known for being witty.\n\nPossible structure:\n1. Greet back.\n2. Self-introduction or reference to my identity.\n3. Ask a question or invite more input to continue the conversation.\n\nFor example:\n- Start with \"Hi!\" or \"Hello!\"\n- Say something like \"I'm Grok, here to help!\"\n- Then, perhaps ask \"How can I assist you today?\" or something more casual.\n\nSince the user might be starting a chat, I should make it conversational.\n\nEnsure it's truthful: Everything I say should be accurate. No need to fabricate anything here.\n\nFinal response idea:\n- Keep it concise and friendly.",
