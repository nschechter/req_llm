          "text": "# The Dragonbound Chronicles\n\n## Part One: The Awakening\n\nThe village of Thornhaven had stood at the edge of the Whisperwood for three hundred years, and in all that time, no one had seen a living dragon. They existed only in stories—tales the elderly told children by firelight, legends carved into the ancient standing stones that dotted the countryside, warnings in dusty tomes kept locked in the monastery's deepest vaults.\n\nBut on the morning of the autumn equinox, when seventeen-year-old Kael Stormwind climbed the rocky hills behind his family's farm to check on their wayward goats, everything changed.\n\nThe egg was larger than a wagon wheel, nestled in a crater of scorched earth that hadn't been there the day before. Its surface shimmered with scales that shifted color in the dawn light—crimson bleeding into gold, gold fading to deep purple, purple sparking with veins of silver. Heat radiated from it in waves, and as Kael approached, he could have sworn he heard a sound like a heartbeat, steady and strong, echoing from within the shell.\n\nHe should have run back to the village. He should have alerted the Elder Council, called for the monastery guards, done anything other than what he did. But Kael had always been curious, perhaps too curious for his own good. His mother often said that curiosity would be either his greatest gift or his final downfall.\n\nHe reached out and touched the egg.\n\nThe world exploded into fire and light.\n\nWhen Kael opened his eyes—had he fallen? Had he been thrown?—the egg lay cracked open like a broken geode, and sitting in the center of the scattered shells was a dragon. It was no larger than a hunting hound, with scales of deep midnight blue shot through with silver, like starlight captured in sapphire. Its eyes, already intelligent and ancient despite being newly born, fixed on Kael with an intensity that made his breath catch.\n\nThose eyes were the same unusual violet color as his own.\n\nThe dragon's voice entered his mind not as sound but as pure meaning, as natural as his own thoughts: *Bonded. You and I. Fate sealed. Together, we fly.*\n\nKael tried to speak, but no words came. The dragon—he somehow knew it was male—tilted his head, then stumbled forward on unsteady legs, leaving the ruined egg behind. Without understanding why, Kael opened his arms, and the dragon collapsed into them, suddenly as weak as any newborn creature. Kael felt the exhaustion radiating from the small body, the tremendous effort it had taken just to break free from the shell.\n\n\"I'll call you Nightwing,\" Kael whispered, and the dragon's contentment flooded through their newly formed bond like warm honey.\n\nThat was the easy part. The hard part was getting home without being seen.\n\n---\n\nKael's family farm was modest—a stone cottage with a thatched roof, a barn for their three goats and elderly plow horse, and fields where they grew barley and turnips. His father had died two winters ago, leaving Kael, his mother Mira, and his younger sister Elara to manage as best they could. They weren't wealthy, but they weren't starving either. They existed in that precarious space that most common folk occupied—one good harvest away from comfort, one bad winter away from disaster.\n\nKael managed to smuggle Nightwing into the barn, hiding him in an unused stall beneath piles of old hay. His mother was at the market, and Elara was supposed to be studying her letters with the village teacher, which gave him a few hours to figure out what to do.\n\nThe problem was the law. Three centuries ago, during the Dragon Wars, King Aldrich the Peacemaker had decreed that all dragons were to be destroyed and any human found harboring, aiding, or bonding with a dragon would be executed. The law had never been repealed, even though no one had seen a dragon in living memory.\n\nUntil now.\n\n\"You're being an idiot,\" came a voice from the barn door.\n\nKael spun around to find his sister standing there, arms crossed, her expression a mix of exasperation and excitement. At thirteen, Elara already had the sharp wit and sharper tongue that would someday make her a formidable woman—if Kael didn't strangle her first.\n\n\"Elara! What are you—you're supposed to be at lessons!\"\n\n\"Master Fenwick is sick. We were dismissed.\" She strode into the barn with the confidence of someone who knew they held all the cards. \"I saw you sneaking back from the hills, carrying something under your coat. You looked guilty as a fox in a henhouse. So I followed you.\" Her eyes widened as Nightwing poked his head out from beneath the hay. \"Is that... is that really...?\"\n\n\"Don't scream,\" Kael said quickly.\n\n\"I'm not going to scream, you dolt. I'm not six.\" Elara knelt down, extending her hand slowly. Nightwing sniffed it, then made a sound somewhere between a purr and a chirp. \"By the Old Gods, he's beautiful. What's his name?\"\n\n\"Nightwing.\"\n\n\"Fitting.\" She looked up at Kael, and her expression turned serious. \"You know what this means, don't you? If anyone finds out—\"\n\n\"I know. Execution. But I can't—\" He struggled to find the words. \"Elara, we're bonded. I don't fully understand it yet, but I can feel him in my mind. His thoughts, his emotions. He's part of me now. Killing him would be like cutting out my own heart.\"\n\nElara was quiet for a long moment. Then she stood up and brushed the hay from her skirts. \"Then we'll have to make sure no one finds out. At least not until we figure out what to do.\"\n\n\"We?\"\n\nHis sister gave him a look that could melt steel. \"Did you really think I'd let you handle this alone? You can barely remember to milk the goats on time.\"\n\nDespite everything, Kael smiled. \"Thanks, El.\"\n\n\"Don't thank me yet. We've got a dragon to hide, and he won't stay puppy-sized forever. Dragons grow fast, don't they? At least, that's what the old stories say.\"\n\nShe was right, of course. Over the next few weeks, Nightwing grew at an alarming rate. Within a month, he was the size of a fully grown horse. Within two months, his wings could spread wide enough to brush both walls of the barn. Kael had to start hunting in the deep forest to find enough deer and wild boar to feed him, claiming he was selling the meat at distant markets to explain his long absences.\n\nHis mother suspected something was wrong, but she didn't press. Mira Stormwind had learned long ago that her son needed space to sort through his own troubles. She trusted him, which made keeping the secret even harder.\n\nThrough their bond, Kael and Nightwing learned to communicate with increasing sophistication. The dragon spoke of ancient memories—not his own, but something deeper, older, like racial knowledge passed down through blood and bone. He told Kael of the Dragon Wars, of the great betrayal, of how dragons had once lived in harmony with certain humans until fear and jealousy had torn everything apart.\n\n\"There were Dragonbound then,\" Nightwing said one night, his voice echoing in Kael's mind as they sat together under the stars. The dragon was too large now to hide in the barn, so they'd taken to meeting in a hidden cave in the hills. \"Humans and dragons, bonded in soul and purpose. Together, they kept the balance. But those without bonds grew envious. They feared what they couldn't understand. So they turned the kingdoms against us.\"\n\n\"Is that why the eggs disappeared?\" Kael asked. \"Why no dragons have been seen for centuries?\"\n\n\"We went into the Deep Sleep. The last of the free dragons cast a great spell, hiding our eggs throughout the world, setting them to wake only when the time was right, when the bonds could be reformed.\" Nightwing's huge head swung toward Kael, his violet eyes glowing in the darkness. \"You woke me. That means the time has come. We are the first, Kael Stormwind, but we will not be the last.\"\n\nA chill ran down Kael's spine. \"There are more eggs?\"\n\n\"Dozens. Hundreds. All waiting for the right moment, the right person. Change is coming, bonded-mine. A storm that will shake the world.\"\n\n---\n\n## Part Two: The Gathering Storm\n\nThe first sign that Nightwing was right came three months after his hatching, when a traveling merchant arrived in Thornhaven with impossible news: a dragon had been spotted in the northern mountains, near the fortress city of Ironkeep. Not an egg, but a fully-grown dragon, with scales like rubies and fire that could melt stone.\n\nThe second sign came a week later, when a royal decree was posted in the village square. King Edmund—great-great-grandson of Aldrich the Peacemaker—was offering a reward of ten thousand gold crowns for information leading to the capture or death of any dragon. Furthermore, all citizens were required to report any strange eggs, unusual animal behavior, or suspicious activity.\n\nThe Dragon Hunts had begun again.\n\n\"We can't stay here,\" Elara said urgently that night, after their mother had gone to bed. She'd become Kael's co-conspirator, often carrying messages to Nightwing and helping to cover Kael's absences. \"If someone sees Nightwing, if anyone reports us—\"\n\n\"I know.\" Kael paced their small cottage, his mind racing. \"But where would we go? The law extends across all seven kingdoms. There's nowhere safe.\"\n\n\"What about beyond the kingdoms?\" Elara suggested. \"The Wildlands, or the Frozen Wastes, or—\"\n\n\"The Wildlands are full of bandits and worse. And the Frozen Wastes would kill us in a week.\" He stopped pacing and looked at his sister. \"Unless...\"\n\n\"Unless what?\"\n\n\"Nightwing told me something. He said we're not the only ones. That more eggs are hatching, more bonds forming. What if we could find them? What if we weren't alone?\"\n\nElara's eyes lit up. \"You want to find the others. Form some kind of... what, dragon rider alliance?\"\n\n\"I don't know what I want. I just know we can't fight this alone.\" He sat down heavily. \"But I can't ask you to come with me. Or Mother. This is my problem.\"\n\n\"Don't be stupid. Where you go, I go.\" Elara's voice was fierce. \"Besides, you'll need someone with actual common sense to keep you alive.\"\n\nThey spent the next few days preparing in secret. Kael sold several of their possessions to a traveling merchant, claiming they needed the money for winter supplies. He cached dried food, warm clothing, and basic supplies in the cave where Nightwing hid. Elara copied maps from the monastery library, pretending she was working on a school project.\n\nThe hard part was their mother.\n\nKael waited until the night before they planned to leave. Mira was sitting by the fire, mending one of his shirts, when he sat down across from her.\n\n\"Mother,\" he began, \"I need to tell you something.\"\n\nShe looked up, and he saw that her eyes were sad but unsurprised. \"You're leaving.\"\n\n\"How did you—\"\n\n\"I'm your mother, Kael. I know you.\" She set down the mending. \"I don't know what trouble you've found, and part of me doesn't want to know. But I know it must be serious, because you've been carrying the weight of the world these past months.\"\n\nKael felt tears prick his eyes. He wanted to tell her everything, to share the burden, but he couldn't. The less she knew, the safer she'd be.\n\n\"I can't explain,\" he said quietly. \"But I promise I'm not doing anything evil or wrong. I'm trying to do what's right, even though the law says otherwise.\"\n\nMira was quiet for a long time. Then she stood up, went to the wooden chest in the corner of the room, and pulled out something wrapped in oiled cloth. When she unfolded it, Kael gasped.\n\nIt was a sword—not a common blade, but something ancient and beautiful, with a hilt wrapped in silver wire and a blade that seemed to shimmer with its own inner light. Strange runes ran along the fuller.\n\n\"This was your father's,\" Mira said softly. \"And his father's before him, going back generations. It's a Dragonbond blade, forged in the old times when humans",
