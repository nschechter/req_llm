          "text": "# The Last Dragon Riders\n\n## Part One: The Summoning\n\nThe morning mist clung to the valley like a living thing, reluctant to surrender to the rising sun. Kael stood at the edge of the cliff, his worn leather cloak whipping around him in the mountain wind, and stared at the impossible sight before him.\n\nThe dragon was massive—easily the size of three great castles stacked upon one another. Its scales shimmered between deep crimson and burnished gold, each one the size of a shield, catching the weak sunlight and scattering it across the rocky landscape. The creature's eyes, a luminous amber that seemed to contain entire fires within them, regarded Kael with what he could only interpret as ancient intelligence.\n\n\"You came,\" the dragon spoke, and its voice was like thunder rolling through distant mountains, yet somehow Kael could understand every word perfectly in his mind. \"After so long, finally, one of your kind has answered the call.\"\n\nKael's hands trembled. He forced himself to stand straight, to show no fear, though his heart hammered against his ribs like a caged bird desperate for escape. He was a simple scholar—a keeper of old books in the Library of Aldermoor, nothing more. He had no business standing before a dragon, no training, no ancient bloodline of dragon riders that he knew of.\n\n\"I... I am here,\" Kael managed to say, his voice hoarse from the long climb up the mountain. \"But I don't understand why I was called. The dreams, the visions—they led me here, but I don't know what you want of me.\"\n\nThe dragon lowered its great head, bringing its snout close enough that Kael could feel the heat radiating from its nostrils. The creature's breath smelled of cinnamon and sulfur, ancient and primal.\n\n\"My name is Mortecai,\" the dragon said. \"For three hundred and seventy-two years, I have waited in this mountain, watching your kind stumble through the ages, making the same mistakes over and over. War, greed, cruelty—each generation thinking themselves original in their sins. But now, a darkness rises that will make all previous ages seem like peaceful dreams. I sent the calling because I can no longer face it alone, scholar. I need a Rider.\"\n\n\"A Rider?\" Kael echoed. \"Surely you mistake me for someone else. I've never ridden anything more exotic than a horse, and those poorly. I'm a scholar of dead languages and forgotten histories. I'm nobody.\"\n\nMortecai's rumbling laugh echoed across the mountaintop, and Kael felt it vibrate through the very ground beneath his feet. \"The greatest riders are never those who seek the role. I chose you because of what you are—a keeper of knowledge, a seeker of truth. Your mind is open to possibilities that warriors would dismiss. Your fingers are stained with ink, not blood.\" The dragon paused, studying him with those magnificent eyes. \"And because your bloodline carries the old magic, even if you know nothing of it.\"\n\nKael wanted to protest further, but something inside him stirred—a memory that wasn't his own, a flash of images: a woman with silver hair in the dress of ancient times, standing with her hand on the neck of a dragon; the roar of dragons in flight, their wings blotting out the sun; a city of marble and crystal burning in the night; and underneath it all, a terrible sense of purpose, of destiny.\n\nHe gasped, staggering backward, and Mortecai's head rose, watching him with concern.\n\n\"You remember,\" the dragon said. It was not a question. \"The genetic memory runs through your blood. Your ancestor rode with my kind, five hundred years ago, in the last great war against the Shadow. That power never truly dies—it merely sleeps, waiting for one of her line to awaken it.\"\n\n\"This is madness,\" Kael whispered, but even as he said it, the memories grew clearer. He could almost hear the thunder of wings, could almost feel the transcendent joy of flight, the bond between rider and dragon that was deeper than blood, more intimate than love.\n\n\"Madness?\" Mortecai tilted his great head. \"Perhaps. But it is a necessary madness. Come. Climb onto my back. Let me show you what you were meant to be.\"\n\nEvery rational thought in Kael's mind screamed at him to run, to flee down the mountain and back to his safe library, back to his safe life of dusty books and predictable days. But something deeper—something primal and true—rose in him. With hands that shook only slightly, he approached the dragon.\n\nUp close, Mortecai was even more magnificent. Kael could see each individual scale, could see the intricate patterns of ridges and whorls that covered the creature's body. The dragon had settled lower, bringing a section of his back within climbing distance, and Kael could see worn spots where ancient riders had gripped his scales.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Kael climbed.\n\nThe scales were warm and textured beneath his hands, surprisingly not slippery, but with enough grip to aid his ascent. It took him several minutes to work his way up the dragon's body until he was sitting near the base of his neck, where a natural hollow formed a perfect seat. He grasped the ridge of scales in front of him, his fingers tight.\n\n\"Hold on,\" Mortecai said, \"and don't let fear overcome you. Fear is an anchor that will drag you down. Joy, wonder, exhilaration—these will set you free.\"\n\nThen the ground fell away.\n\nIn his entire life, Kael had never experienced anything approaching what happened next. One moment, he was firmly mounted on the ledge; the next, the earth dropped away beneath him as Mortecai launched himself into the air with a powerful thrust of his hind legs. The dragon's wings—vast expanses of deep crimson membrane stretched across bone and sinew—beat once, twice, thrice, and suddenly Kael was so high above the ground that the valley looked like a child's painting.\n\nHis scream died in his throat, transformed into something between a shout of pure terror and a sound of unadulterated joy. His stomach lurched, his hands gripped tighter, and then—\n\nThen something changed. The fear didn't disappear, but it transformed into something else, something exquisite. The wind rushed past him, carrying him upward ever higher. The sun burst from behind the clouds, and suddenly they broke through into a realm of pure blue sky and white clouds that towered around them like mountains. Mortecai banked sharply, and Kael leaned into the turn, feeling not an inertial drag but a perfect balance, as though dragon and rider were one being in that moment.\n\n\"Yes!\" Mortecai's mind-voice blazed with triumph. \"Yes, you understand! You feel it already—the bond! The ancient magic knows you, recognizes you!\"\n\nAnd Kael could feel it—a presence at the edge of his mind that was not his own thoughts. It was vast and ancient and utterly foreign, yet somehow more intimate than his own consciousness. It was Mortecai, sharing his perceptions, showing him the world through the eyes of a dragon. He could feel the currents of air beneath Mortecai's wings, could sense the thermal drafts before the dragon adjusted course to catch them. He could feel the dragon's joy, pure and transcendent, at having a Rider once more after so many centuries of solitude.\n\nThey flew for hours. Mortecai showed him the hidden valleys and secret peaks of the mountains, showed him vistas that Kael never knew existed. They climbed higher and higher, until the air grew thin and cold, and Kael could see the curve of the world itself against the darkness of space. Then they dove, plummeting toward the earth with such speed that Kael's heart seemed to lodge in his throat, until at the last possible moment, Mortecai spread his wings and caught the air, pulling up in a maneuver that should have flung Kael off but somehow didn't.\n\nWhen they finally returned to the cave that Mortecai called home—a vast chamber deep within the mountain, lined with a fortune in gold and jewels and ancient artifacts—Kael was exhilarated and utterly exhausted. He tumbled off the dragon's back and collapsed onto a pile of soft furs that had been arranged in a corner.\n\n\"Rest,\" Mortecai said gently. \"Tomorrow, we train. The night grows short, but the darkness that approaches is far darker still. And we must prepare.\"\n\nAs Kael drifted toward sleep, he heard the dragon's ancient voice one more time:\n\n\"Welcome back, Rider. Welcome home.\"\n\n---\n\n## Part Two: The Gathering\n\nKael awoke to golden sunlight streaming through the cave entrance and the smell of roasted meat. His entire body ached in ways he didn't know were possible. Every muscle screamed in protest as he sat up, but it was the good sort of ache—the ache of having been tested and found sufficient, of having accomplished something extraordinary.\n\nMortecai lay curled in the center of the cave, a small dragon perched on his chest—no larger than a horse, with scales of deep emerald green. This smaller dragon lifted its head at Kael's movement and made a sound like a cat's purr magnified a thousand times.\n\n\"Ah, I'm glad you're awake,\" Mortecai said. \"Kael, this is Verdania. She is my daughter, though she has never had a Rider of her own. Today, perhaps that will change.\"\n\nVerdania's green eyes fixed on Kael with intense interest. She was beautiful in a different way than Mortecai—more delicate, despite still being roughly the size of a horse. Patterns of gold traced through her scales like veins of ore through stone.\n\n\"Another dragon?\" Kael managed, his voice rough with sleep. \"I didn't know dragons could... well...\"\n\n\"Have children?\" Mortecai's rumbling laugh was gentler this morning. \"Yes, though it happens rarely. Verdania is nearly two hundred years old, quite young for her kind. And she has been waiting for a Rider as patiently as I have.\"\n\nVerdania hopped down from Mortecai's chest and approached Kael, tilting her head curiously. She sniffed at him with nostrils that leaked small wisps of smoke, and Kael held his ground, remembering what Mortecai had said about fear.\n\n\"Hello, Verdania,\" he said quietly. \"I'm Kael.\"\n\nThe dragon made a pleased chirping sound and rubbed her head against his leg like a giant cat. Kael felt something warm unfold in his chest—a smaller echo of the bond he shared with Mortecai, but distinct. Where Mortecai's presence in his mind was vast and overwhelming, Verdania's was playful and curious.\n\n\"She likes you,\" Mortecai observed. \"That is good. But we have much to discuss, and little time to discuss it.\"\n\nThe dragon rose to his full height, moving to the mouth of the cave. \"Come. There is someone you need to meet.\"\n\n---\n\nAs it turned out, \"someone\" was actually three someones, waiting in a hidden valley several miles from Mortecai's cave. They were not, to Kael's surprise, ancient dragon riders garbed in the dress of legend. Instead, they were a surprisingly motley crew.\n\nThe first was a warrior woman, tall and muscular, with deep brown skin and close-cropped hair streaked with gray. She introduced herself as Captain Sira and claimed to have once been a soldier in the Valdor Kingdom. The second was a thin, nervous man with spectacles and ink-stained fingers—a fellow scholar, which made Kael feel slightly less out of place—named Matthias, who had been studying the ancient texts in the Archives of Kelthorne. The third was a half-elf girl no more than sixteen, with pale skin and hair the color of moonlight, introducing herself only as \"Whisper\" and claiming no kingdom or allegiance.\n\n\"Where are their dragons?\" Kael asked Mortecai quietly.\n\n\"They will arrive soon,\" Mortecai replied. \"Others of my kind have also felt the call of the darkness and recognized that we cannot stand alone. They will bring their own Riders—or those who may become Riders. Some will accept the bond; some will not. That is the way of dragons.\"\n\nAs if in response to his words, the sky filled with wings.\n\nThree dragons descended toward the valley in perfect formation, each as magnificent as Mortecai in their own way. One was a deep midnight blue with silver horns that spiraled like ancient stone; another was bronze and red like a sunset, with wings that seemed to shimmer with internal light; the",
