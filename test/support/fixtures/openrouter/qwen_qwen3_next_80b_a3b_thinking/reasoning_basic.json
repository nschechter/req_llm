            "reasoning": "Okay, so I need to solve 12 times 7. Let me think. Hmm, multiplication. Right, 12 multiplied by 7. How do I approach this?\n\nWell, maybe breaking it down into smaller parts would help. Like, I remember that 10 times 7 is 70. Then there's the extra 2. So 2 times 7 is 14. If I add those together, 70 plus 14... that should be 84. Wait, let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the distributive property. 12 is 10 + 2, so (10 + 2) * 7 = 10*7 + 2*7 = 70 +14. Yep, same result. 70+14 is 84. Another way might be to double 12 three times and then add another 12? Wait, no, maybe that's complicating. Let's see: 12*2 is 24, 12*3 is 36, but maybe not necessary.\n\nWait, maybe just straight multiplication. 7 times 2 is 14, carry over the 1. Then 7 times 1 is 7, plus the carried 1 makes 8. So the result is 84. Oh right, that's the standard algorithm method. So writing it out:\n\n  12\nx  7\n------\n  84\n\nBecause 7*2=14, write down 4, carry 1. Then 7*1=7, plus 1 is 8. So yes, 84.\n\nAlternatively, think of 7*10=70, 7*2=14, sum to 84. Yep, all methods point to 84. I think that's right. Let me verify with another approach. If I know that 6*7=42, then 12*7 would be double that, since 12 is 6*2. So 42*2=84. Exactly. So that's another check. Okay, confident that 84 is the correct answer.\n",
