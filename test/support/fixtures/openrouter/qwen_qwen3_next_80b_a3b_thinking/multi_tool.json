The location is specified as Paris, France. The unit isn't mentioned, so maybe default to Celsius? But the parameters say unit is optional, with enum celsius or fahrenheit. Since the user didn't specify, maybe I should just use the location and not include unit, or maybe default to celsius. Wait, the required field is only location, so unit is optional. So I can call get_weather with location \"Paris, France\" and maybe omit unit. But sometimes people might expect Fahrenheit, but since it's France, probably Celsius is standard. However, the function allows unit to be specified, but since the user didn't say, maybe just provide the location. Let me check the parameters again. The get_weather function has required [\"location\"], so unit is optional. So the correct call is to pass location as \"Paris, France\" and not include unit. So the tool call should be {\"name\": \"get_weather\", \"arguments\": {\"location\": \"Paris, France\"}}. Yeah, that's right. No need to specify unit unless the user asked for it. So I should generate that tool call.\n",
