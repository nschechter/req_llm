            "reasoning": "First, the user asked to solve 12 multiplied by 7, and to show my internal thinking briefly. So, I need to multiply 12 by 7.\n\nMultiplication is straightforward: 12 times 7 means I need to add 12 to itself 7 times. But that might be inefficient. I can break it down into simpler parts.\n\nI know that 10 times 7 is 70, and 2 times 7 is 14. So, if I add those together, 70 plus 14 equals 84. That makes sense.\n\nI could also think of it as 7 times 12, which is the same thing. 7 times 10 is 70, 7 times 2 is 14, 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nSince 12 is 10 + 2, I can distribute the multiplication: (10 + 2) * 7 = 10*7 + 2*7 = 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nI recall that 12 times 7 is a common multiplication fact. I think it's 84. I should confirm that.\n\nLet me do the multiplication step by step. Start with 2 times 7 is 14, so I write down 4 and carry over 1. Then, 1 times 7 is 7, plus the carry-over 1 is 8. So, it's 84. Yeah, that matches.\n\nSo, the answer is 84.\n\nNow, for the internal thinking, I need to show it briefly. I should mention that I used the distributive property or broke it down into tens and ones.\n\nSomething like: \"I thought of 12 as 10 + 2. Then, 10 × 7 = 70 and 2 × 7 = 14. Adding them together: 70 + 14 = 84.\"\n\nThat seems brief and clear.\n\nI could also say: \"Multiplied 12 by 7 by first multiplying 10 by 7 to get 70, then 2 by 7 to get 14, and added them to get 84.\"\n\nEither way, it should be fine.\n\nFinally, present the answer.",
