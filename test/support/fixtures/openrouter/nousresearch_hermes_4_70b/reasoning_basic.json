            "reasoning": "\nOkay, so I need to solve 12 multiplied by 7. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that multiplication is basically repeated addition, so 12 times 7 means adding 12 a total of 7 times. But that might take a while. Maybe there's a quicker way.\n\nAlternatively, I can break down the numbers to make the calculation easier. Let me see. 12 is the same as 10 plus 2. So if I split it into 10 and 2, then multiply each part by 7 and add them together. That might work. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, 10 times 7 is straightforward. That's 70. Then, 2 times 7 is 14. Adding those two results together: 70 plus 14. Hmm, 70 plus 10 is 80, and then plus 4 more is 84. So, 12 multiplied by 7 equals 84. \n\nWait, let me check that again to be sure. Another way to think about it is 7 times 12. Sometimes swapping the numbers helps. 7 times 10 is 70, and 7 times 2 is 14. Adding them gives the same result, 84. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nI could also use the distributive property here. 12*7 can be thought of as (10 + 2)*(7) = 10*7 + 2*7. Which is exactly what I did before. So that checks out. \n\nAnother method might be to use doubles. I know that 7 times 2 is 14, so 7 times 4 would be 28, doubling again gives 7 times 8 as 56. But wait, that's doubling the multiplier each time. Maybe that's not the most efficient here. Let me see. If I double 7 three times, 7, 14, 28, 56. But 12 is 8 + 4. So 7 times 8 is 56, plus 7 times 4 is 28. 56 + 28 is 84. Oh, that works too. So breaking 12 into 8 and 4, then doubling the 7s. \n\nEither way, whether breaking into 10 and 2 or 8 and 4, the result is 84. I can also recall the multiplication table for 7. 7 times 11 is 77, so adding one more 7 gives 84. That's another way to verify. \n\nSo all these different methods lead me to the same answer, 84. I think that's solid. No mistakes in the calculations, and multiple methods confirm the result. Yep, confident that 12*7 is 84.\n",
