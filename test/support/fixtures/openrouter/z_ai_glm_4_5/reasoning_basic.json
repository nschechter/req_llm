            "reasoning": "\nFirst, the user asked to solve 12 times 7 and show my internal thinking briefly. So, I need to calculate 12 * 7 and explain my thought process concisely.\n\nI know that multiplication is repeated addition. So, 12 * 7 means adding 12 to itself 7 times. Let me verify that.\n\n12 + 12 = 24\n\n24 + 12 = 36\n\n36 + 12 = 48\n\n48 + 12 = 60\n\n60 + 12 = 72\n\n72 + 12 = 84\n\nSo, adding 12 seven times gives me 84. Therefore, 12 * 7 = 84.\n\nI also recall basic multiplication facts. I remember that 10 times 7 is 70, and 2 times 7 is 14. So, since 12 is 10 plus 2, I can do (10 * 7) + (2 * 7) = 70 + 14 = 84. That's another way to get the same answer.\n\nAnother method: I can think of 12 * 7 as 12 times 7. I know the multiplication table: 7 times 12 is 84. Yes, that's a standard fact.\n\nI could use the distributive property again but differently. For example, 12 * 7 = 12 * (5 + 2) = (12 * 5) + (12 * 2) = 60 + 24 = 84. Same result.\n\nSince 7 is a smaller number, I might compute 7 * 12 directly. 7 * 10 = 70, 7 * 2 = 14, 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nAll methods point to 84.\n\nNow, for the internal thinking part, I need to be brief. So, I should summarize one of these approaches efficiently.\n\nI think the repeated addition or the distributive property using 10 and 2 is straightforward.\n\nLet me outline my internal thinking:\n\n1. Recognize that 12 * 7 can be broken down.\n\n2. I can add 12 seven times, but that might take longer, so better to use a smarter way.\n\n3. Use the fact that 12 * 7 = (10 + 2) * 7 = 10*7 + 2*7.\n\n4. 10*7 = 70\n\n5. 2*7 = 14\n\n6. 70 + 14 = 84\n\nThat seems clear and brief.\n\nSince it's a simple problem, I could just say \"I recall that 12 times 7 is 84 from multiplication tables.\" But that might not show much internal thinking; it's more rote memorization.\n\nThe user said \"show your internal thinking,\" so I should demonstrate a bit of reasoning, even if it's basic.\n\nIn the context of AI, I might be simulating a thought process, so showing a step-by-step calculation is good.\n\nFinally, present the answer.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\nInternal thinking: I break down 12 * 7 into (10 * 7) + (2 * 7) since 12 is 10 + 2. Then, 10 * 7 = 70 and 2 * 7 = 14. Adding them gives 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nAnswer: 84\n\nTo make it even briefer, but I think that's fine.\n\nSince the user said \"brief,\" I shouldn't over-explain.\n\nAnother way: I could think in terms of groups. 12 groups of 7, or 7 groups of 12; since multiplication is commutative, it's the same.\n\nBut 7 groups of 12 might be easier: 7 * 12.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating. I'll go with the distributive property approach.",
