Hmm, this seems like a straightforward multiplication problem, but they specifically want to see the reasoning process—not just the answer. \n\nI wonder if they're a student practicing mental math or maybe a teacher checking how I approach simple calculations. The \"brief\" part suggests they don't want an overly detailed breakdown, just the key steps. \n\nLet me recall how I'd compute this naturally. Breaking it down: 10×7 is 70, and 2×7 is 14, then add them. That’s the distributive property—easy to do mentally. Alternatively, I could think of 12×7 as (12×5) + (12×2), but the first method feels more intuitive for this pair. \n\nWait, should I mention memorization? Like, \"I know 12×7=84 from the times table\"? But showing the *method* seems more useful here since they asked for \"thinking.\" Yeah, the breakdown is better—it demonstrates understanding, not just recall. \n\nAlso, no signs this is a trick question. Just multiplying two single-digit-multiplied-by-double-digit numbers. Keeping it simple: focus on the cleanest path to 84. \n\n...Double-checking: 7×10=70, 7×2=14, 70+14=84. Yep, solid. No need for alternatives unless asked. \n\nFinal thought: User said \"brief,\" so I’ll compress this into two steps max. No fluff.\n",
