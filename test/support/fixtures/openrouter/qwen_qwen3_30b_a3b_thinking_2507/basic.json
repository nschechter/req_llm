Just be friendly and approachable. Let me put that together: \"Hello! 😊 How can I assist you today?\"\n\nWait, the user wrote \"Hello world!\" with an exclamation, so maybe they're referencing the programming term. But since they're talking to me, I'll treat it as a greeting. If they meant the programming thing, they'll clarify later.\n\nDouble-check for any errors.
