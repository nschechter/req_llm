            "content": "On the day the river turned the color of hammered copper and the wind carried sparks instead of seeds, Elyn stood on the roof of the mapmaker’s hall and sketched the sky. She was the sort of apprentice who measured silence as carefully as she measured distance; she frowned at the way the horizon wavered, as though a hand had smeared it. She shaded the patch of forest where the smoke was too thick, and then the page trembled in her grasp. A shadow crossed the city like a ship’s sail unfurling. When she looked up, the shadow had wings.\n\nPeople say that the first time you see a dragon you remember the exact weight of your own breath. Elyn would remember the crackling taste of ash and the bright sting of fear, but also something else—an ache, not unlike longing, like recognizing the shape of a door you’ve always felt behind your heart. The dragon arrowed across the sky, a lean shape the color of slate, with eyes bright as coins and a flight pattern too deliberate to be mindless terror. The city bells shrieked. Markets collapsed into chaos. The mapmaker’s hall emptied below her in a clatter of benches and vellum. The dragon did not descend; instead, it circled once, twice, and on the third turn a ribbon of fire wrote itself on the heavens, very nearly a word.\n\n“Elyn!” Master Tallow’s voice collided with her knees. He was an old man who smelled of binding glue and bay leaves. His hands shook as they gripped her calf. “Down. Down, foolish girl.”\n\nShe slid, stuffed her notebook into her satchel, and then the second sound came, like thunder dragging a plow through stone. The dragon had alighted beyond the city’s ring wall, in the wheat that had not yet turned to copper. The guards mustered. The bells kept tolling. Elyn swallowed and looked at her master. “If I can see where it landed—”\n\n“You will go nowhere. The last war paid for your curiosity ten thousand times over.”\n\nHe meant the War of Throats, when dragons and humans melted each other’s bones with hubris. He meant the scorched swathes of the north that still hummed. He meant treaties drawn in blood and salt. Elyn nodded because he was afraid and because she loved him, and because every good apprentice knows the boundaries they intend to cross.\n\nIn the night Elyn crept out with her satchel and a coil of twine. The city slept sour, dreaming of flame. She slipped through the south gate where the closes had finally gone black, and her feet knew the geometry of the roads by touch. Outside the walls the fields lay tatty and ashamed. The tall stalks were frozen into glassy curls where dragonfire had brushed them. There was a path, even a careful one, where the heavy foreclaws had pressed. Elyn stepped where the dragon had stepped, because it felt like a sort of pact.\n\nShe found it by the river in a stand of alder. Its head lay on its forelegs, enormous, ridged. The eyes were closed. Even sleeping, it radiated a pressure like weather, as if the space around it was heavier than elsewhere. Elyn crouched and drew the lines of its ribcage with a pencil. It wore a harness. That surprised her enough that she stopped drawing. The harness was cunning work—human leather and brass, fitted to scales, with sigils stitched into the backing. The straps were empty where the saddle should have been. A sheaf of arrows lay near its shoulder, snapped.\n\n“You draw,” said the dragon without opening its eyes. “Interesting.”\n\nElyn’s pencil made a bright scratch. “Only what is there.”\n\n“Mm,” the dragon said, which contained both skepticism and a humoring patience. Its eyelids lifted. The pupils were vertical slits that dilated and then narrowed again. “There are a great many things to draw. Other things are also there.”\n\n“You speak our tongue,” Elyn said.\n\nThe dragon unfolded and sat up like a mountain deciding to stand. It shook itself. Embers spun from its mane and went out midair. “We always did. We found it cleaner.”\n\nShe had a list of questions on the back of her skull, each tugging at strings: Did it have a name? Was it here alone? Was it responsible for the copper river? Was the harness a captivity or a fashion?\n\nThe dragon eyed her satchel. “You are a mapmaker,” it said, almost kindly. “I have need of one.”\n\nElyn’s heart tripped. “Master Tallow says treaties forbid—”\n\n“Do your masters forbid the world from changing?” The dragon’s lips peeled back from its teeth, not in threat so much as weariness. “Listen, small cartographer. I am called Inys. I wear a harness because a human asked me, and then that same human fell. The world is burning itself out, spoiling from inside. The copper river? A seam of ore discovered by the Warden of Ingleholt, bled into the water to smelt the fish while they swim. The sky? Soot from furnaces that never stop.” The dragon looked at the river with pity uncommon to its shape. “Your maps are wrong now. The lines are moving. I need the old ones. I need to find the Concord.”\n\nElyn stared. The Concord was story, the treaty so old it wore myth like a cloak—the agreement dragons and humans had once forged, more delicate than silk, binding fire to hearth and sword to scabbard. The Concord had failed, the elders said. It had been betrayed. It belonged with the first songs, dust on tongue.\n\n“I don’t have those maps,” Elyn whispered.\n\n“You have hands, and shoes, and a spine that will keep you upright where others bend. Come with me. Draw what we pass. Find what was lost.”\n\nIt is one thing to be asked to choose and another to notice you have already chosen. Elyn’s tears surprised her with their salt. She nodded. Inys dipped its shoulder and she climbed the harness as though it had been meant for her. When they rose, the city below was a scatter of lamps, tremulous and pathetic, and the river was a hammered strip of metal unspooling into the east.\n\nThey flew in midnight and dawn. Inys disliked noon; too many thermals, it said, too many clumsy human contraptions now clawing at the sky. Elyn learned to sleep against the grain of scales, to memorise the way landscapes stitched together from the vantage of clouds. She ate what Inys brought her—rabbits charred, a clutch of river eggs, once a mouthful of lightning that tasted like fennel and bit her tongue numb. She sketched a lot: the slats of old bridges, the teeth of ridges, the way villages had moved uphill to avoid floods. Sometimes Inys told her stories, in the slow way of beings who have measured centuries by heartbeats.\n\n“Once, if a child met a dragon by the river, they played riddles with sticks,” Inys said, flying low over marshland. “Now, the child tells on the dragon, and a man with a pulley and a speech about progress arrives.”\n\n“Humans forget,” Elyn said, and regretted it. “We have only one life. We are good at making it loud.”\n\n“You make noise,” Inys mused. “Dragons make weather. Both ruin a picnic.”\n\nBy the time they struck the Spine of Glass—the jagged range that separated the soft belly of the south from the starved highlands—news of dragons had outpaced them. Smoke rose from beacons chained Peak to Peak. The mountain holds had sealed their iron doors, and the sky had nets strung in it, gossamer traps weighted with cunning. Inys burned one into strings and spit bronze rivets from between its teeth. Elyn held on and tasted fear like wine.\n\nOn the fourth day a crew of sky-fishermen threw up hooks from a cliff and latched into Inys’s wing membrane. Inys roared. The sound knocked three men from the parapet. Elyn worked without thought. She cut the line nearest, then snatched a fallen hook and leaned over the saddle to hack the others. A net billowed, a curtain of knotted wire. Inys rolled and the world was a coin flipping. Elyn lost the knife. The wire caught her sleeve and bit her arm. She gasped, dropped, and was saved by a strip of harness that grabbed her ribs and bruised her into breath again.\n\nWhen they finally gained air clear of the mountains, Elyn peeled back her sleeve in uglier light. The wire had left a lattice of wounds. Inys craned its head. Its tongue was surprisingly delicate as it licked her forearm clean. The saliva stung like vinegar and then stopped stinging. The skin knit, not fully, but with intent.\n\n“Thank you,” Elyn said, shaky. “I forgot you had—”\n\n“Salves,” Inys said. “Gifts. Please do not fall. It would inconvenience us both.”\n\nIn the highlands they found ruins that breathed wind through their ribs. There were old courtyards where the cobbles knew dragon claws. There were murals with the colors leeched but the shapes intact: humans and dragons arguing over bread and fire, then dancing, then building a bridge of bones and gold. Elyn found the word Concord in a hundred scripts, and in a hundred places it had been scratched out or painted over.\n\nIn the city of Orusk they found a librarian who did not run. He was a short, square man with eyes like fossil seas. He bowed to Inys and to Elyn with the same depth, which made Elyn’s throat prickle. “You are late,” he said.\n\nInys made a noise like avalanche and laughter. “You are very early, Mir Sareth. The rear guard of a wisdom that did not keep.”\n\nMir Sareth shrugged. “One cannot help chronology.” He led them into halls that smelled of oil and old paper. Elyn’s fingers shook as she unrolled map after map, each drawn in inks no one could afford now. Here were coastlines that bit like wolves. Here were roadways that went through mountains like thread through cloth. Elyn saw, with the clean shock of a whetstone on steel, that what she had always called the world was a version made small.\n\n“Tell me the true purpose of your Concord,” she said to Inys that night, when Mir Sareth had retired and the lamps made islands of light. “Not the songs. Not the treaty of merchants. The heart of it.”\n\nInys stretched on the floor, making a pattern of long shadows. “We bound appetites to stewardship,” it said. “Dragons hunger for things that hum—heat, movement, ideation. We can gorge and leave only cinders. Humans hunger too, with more variety—gold, story, legacy, dominion. We agreed to be each other’s brake. When a dragon would burn, a human would remind it of ash. When a human would build too high, a dragon would sit on the roof until the arrogant remembered the rain.”\n\nElyn thought of the copper river. “And when did you forget?”\n\n“When heroism became a market,” Inys said softly, “and both sides sold it.”\n\nMir Sareth gave them a scrap of a ledger, a copy of a copy of a letter. In that letter, a man named Harrow of the Low said he had seen the Concord’s last safeguard moved. It was not a parchment. It was not a chest in a vault. It was a place with stones. He wrote the name of a valley and a direction to stand in when the moon was thin. He wrote: only a cartographer will find the door. He wrote: take a dragon.\n\nThey travelled north. The land here had learned the vocabulary of ice even in summer. Villages were smaller, full of hands chapped into leather. The Warden’s men had not come here yet with pulleys and speeches; perhaps the ore was too deep. Elyn saw children playing with carved dragons and sticks, teaching them riddles. Inys smiled with their eyes and drowsed, humming to itself in a key too low for humans. They crossed a plain where the grass was so short the ground looked shaved, and in the center of that plain lay the husk of a dragon larger than the hall in Orusk. The bones were silvered, not by decay but by some reaction to the air. Elyn touched a rib as big as a hogshead and felt a whisper on her skin like flint on steel. Inys bowed, and Elyn followed without instruction.\n\n“What was its name?” she asked.\n\nInys closed their eyes. “Mirash. They taught humans to make glass that sings when you wet it. They swallowed a moon once by accident.”\n\nElyn carried that with her like a coin with a hole in it, stringing it on the cord that held all the new things she could not yet reconcile. Seasons shuddered. The moon thinned as required, a clipped nail in the sky. The valley was a graceful scoop between two hills, unremarkable if you did not know how to angle your gaze. Elyn knew. She went out with a string, a compass, and a stubbornness learned in a hall where people had said there was nothing left to discover. She",
