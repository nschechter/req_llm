That's 14.\n*   Finally, I'll add those two results together: 70 + 14.\n*   70 plus 10 is 80, and 80 plus the remaining 4 is 84.\n*   So, 12 * 7 = 84.\n\n**Solution:**\n12 * 7 = **84**",

It's not just about the answer, but *how* an AI arrives at it. It needs to be a conscious, step-by-step representation of a thought process, not just a direct answer.\n\n2.  **Initial Analysis of the Math Problem:**\n    *   The problem is 12 * 7.\n    *   This is a basic, single-digit multiplication with a two-digit number.\n    *   It's one of those multiplication facts that's often just memorized (e.g., through the 7-times table or the 12-times table). 7 x 12 = 84.\n\n3.  **Brainstorming \"Internal Thinking\" Strategies:** How can I represent a thought process that isn't just \"I know this\"? I need to break down the common human ways of solving this. This demonstrates \"thinking\" rather than just data retrieval.\n\n    *   **Strategy 1: Chunking/Distributive Property (The \"Standard\" Algorithm).** This is the most common way people are taught to do multi-digit multiplication on paper.\n        *   Break 12 into its place value parts: 10 and 2.\n        *   Multiply each part by 7.\n        *   7 * 10 = 70\n        *   7 * 2 = 14\n        *   Add the results: 70 + 14 = 84.\n        *   This is a great candidate. It's logical, step-by-step, and easy to explain.\n\n    *   **Strategy 2: Commutative Property.** Some people find 12 * 7 harder than 7 * 12, but the principle is the same. I could mention it, but it's not a primary calculation strategy. It's more about recognizing the order doesn't matter.
