First, I'll multiply the parts: 10 * 7 = 70.\n2.  And the other part: 2 * 7 = 14.\n3.  Finally, I add the two results together: 70 + 14 = 84.",
            "reasoning_content": "\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**\n    *   **Core Task:** Solve the multiplication problem 12 * 7.\n    *   **Constraint 1:** Show the result.\n    *   **Constraint 2:** Show the \"internal thinking\" behind it.\n    *   **Constraint 3:** The \"internal thinking\" should be \"brief\".\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming - How do I solve 12 * 7?**\n    *   **Method 1: Standard Multiplication (the \"on paper\" way).**\n        ```\n          12\n        x  7\n        ----\n        ```\n        *   Step 1: Multiply the ones digit. 2 * 7 = 14.\n        *   Step 2: Write down the 4 in the ones place of the answer.\n        *   Step 3: Carry over the 1 to the tens place.\n        *   Step 4: Multiply the tens digit. 1 * 7 = 7.\n        *   Step 5: Add the carried-over 1. 7 + 1 = 8.\n        *   Step 6: Write down the 8 in the tens place.\n        *   Result: 84.\n        *   *Self-correction:* This is accurate and a common method. It's a good candidate for the \"internal thinking\" part.\n\n    *   **Method 2: Mental Math / Breakdown (the \"in your head\" way).**\n        *   How can I break down 12 to make it easier? 12 is 10 + 2.\n        *   So, 12 * 7 is the same as (10 + 2) * 7.\n        *   Using the distributive property: (10 * 7) + (2 * 7).\n        *   Step 1: 10 * 7 is easy, that's 70.\n        *   Step 2: 2 * 7 is also easy, that's 14.\n        *   Step 3: Add the two results together: 70 + 14.\n        *   Step 4: 70 + 10 is 80. 80 + 4 is 84.\n        *   Result: 84.\n        *   *Self-correction:* This is also very clear and reflects how many people do quick mental math. This is an excellent candidate for the \"internal thinking\" part because it feels more like an internal process than the rote algorithm of Method 1.3.  **Method 3: Another Mental Math approach.**\n    *   How can I break down 7? It's not as easy. 7 is 5 + 2.\n    *   So, 12 * 7 is the same as 12 * (5 + 2).\n    *   Using the distributive property: (12 * 5) + (12 * 2).\n    *   Step 1: 12 * 5. (Half of 12 is 6, add a zero -> 60).\n    *   Step 2: 12 * 2. (Double 12 -> 24).\n    *   Step 3: Add them: 60 + 24.\n    *   Step 4: 60 + 20 is 80. 80 + 4 is 84.\n    *   Result: 84.\n    *   *Self-correction:* This also works perfectly well. However, breaking down the larger number (12) into 10 + 2 is generally considered simpler and more intuitive for most people than breaking down 7. So, Method 2 is probably the better choice for representing a common \"internal\" process.\n\n4.  **Selecting the Best Approach for the Answer:**\n    *   The request asks for *brief* internal thinking.\n    *   Method 2 (breaking down 12 into 10 + 2) is very concise and easy to follow. It feels most like \"thought\".\n    *   Method 1 (the algorithm) is also brief but feels more like a procedure you're taught rather than how you might naturally reason it out. It's a valid internal process, but less \"insightful\" maybe.\n    *   Let's go with Method 2. It's clear, efficient, and a great example of mental math strategy.\n\n5.  **Structuring the Final Answer:**\n    *   I need two parts: the answer and the internal thinking.\n    *   First, state the final answer clearly. \"12 * 7 = 84\".\n    *   Second, explain the chosen thinking process. I'll phrase it as a step-by-step monologue.\n    *   \"I need to multiply 12 by 7.\"\n    *   \"I can break 12 into 10 and 2, which are easier to multiply.\"\n    *   \"First, 10 times 7 is 70.\"\n    *   \"Next, 2 times 7 is 14.\"\n    *   \"Finally, I add those two results together: 70 + 14.\"\n    *   \"70 + 10 is 80, plus 4 more is 84.\"\n    *   This is a good, complete thought process.\n\n6.  **Final Polish:** Combine the parts into a clean, direct response.\n\n    *   **Answer:** 84\n    *   **Internal Thinking:**\n        *   \"I'll break 12 into 10 + 2 to make the multiplication easier.\"\n        *   \"First, calculate 10 * 7 = 70.\"\n        *   \"Then, calculate 2 * 7 = 14.\"\n        *   \"Finally, add the two parts: 70 + 14 = 84.\"\n\n    This looks good. It's accurate, follows the instructions (brief, shows thinking), and is easy to understand. It directly answers the user's prompt. I'll just format it nicely. The chosen structure (Answer first, then thinking) is logical.",
