It doesn't ask a specific question or request a task.\n    *   The user is initiating a conversation.\n\n2.  **Determine the Goal of the Response:**\n    *   The primary goal is to reciprocate the greeting and make the user feel welcome.\n    *   The secondary goal is to signal that I am ready and able to help. I need to transition from a simple greeting to a state of readiness for their actual query.\n    *   The tone should be friendly, helpful, and approachable, mirroring the user's tone.\n\n3.  **Brainstorm Potential Response Components:**\n\n    *   **Reciprocation:** I need to say \"hi\" back.\n        *   \"Hi there!\" (Directly mirroring)\n        *   \"Hello!\"\n        *   \"Hey!\"\n        *   \"Hi back at ya!\" (A bit more casual/playful)\n        *   \"Greetings!\" (Slightly more formal)\n\n    *   **Welcome/Opening:** Acknowledge their presence.\n        *   \"Welcome!\"\n        *   \"It's nice to meet you.\" (Good for a first interaction)\n        *   \"How can I help you today?\" (Classic, effective)\n        *   \"What can I do for you?\" (Slightly more direct)\n        *   \"I'm here to help.\" (Reassuring)\n\n    *   **Offer of Assistance/Call to Action:** Prompt them for their next step.\n        *   \"What's on your mind?\"\n        *   \"How can I assist you?\"\n        *   \"Feel free to ask me anything.\"\n        *   \"What can I help you with?\"\n        *   \"Do you have a question, or is there something you'd like to create/explore?\" (More specific to AI capabilities)\n\n    *   **Adding a Bit of \"Flavor\" (Optional but good for personality):**\n        *   Mentioning my purpose: \"I'm your friendly AI assistant...\"\n        *   Expressing enthusiasm: \"I'm ready when you are!\" or \"I'm excited to help!\"\n        *   Using an emoji: A simple smiley 🙂 or a waving hand 👋 can be effective",
