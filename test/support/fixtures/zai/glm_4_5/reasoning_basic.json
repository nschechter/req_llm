            "reasoning_content": "\nFirst, the user asked to solve 12 times 7 and show my internal thinking briefly. So, I need to calculate the product and explain how I did it in a concise way.\n\nThe multiplication is 12 * 7. I know that multiplication is repeated addition, so 12 * 7 means adding 12 seven times. But that might take a bit, so I should use a more efficient method.\n\nI recall that 12 * 7 can be broken down. For example, I can think of 12 as 10 + 2, and then multiply each part by 7.\n\nSo, 10 * 7 = 70, and 2 * 7 = 14. Then, add them together: 70 + 14.\n\n70 + 14 is 84. That seems straightforward.\n\nI could also do it the other way: 7 * 12. Since multiplication is commutative, it's the same as 12 * 7. So, 7 * 10 = 70, and 7 * 2 = 14, then 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nAnother way is to use the standard multiplication algorithm. Write it down:\n\n  12\n\nx  7\n\nFirst, multiply the units: 2 * 7 = 14. Write down 4, carry over 1.\n\nThen, multiply the tens: 1 * 7 = 7, plus the carry-over 1 = 8. So, it's 84.\n\nThat gives me 84 directly.\n\nI know that 12 * 7 is a basic multiplication fact. From memory, I think it's 84. But I should verify with one of the methods above to be sure.\n\nLet me confirm: 10 * 7 = 70, 2 * 7 = 14, 70 + 14 = 84. Yes.\n\nOr, 12 * 5 = 60, and 12 * 2 = 24, then 60 + 24 = 84. That works too.\n\nSince 7 is small, I can count by 7s: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84. That's 12 times: 7*1=7, 7*2=14, ..., up to 7*12=84. But that's longer, and I don't need to show that step-by-step.\n\nFor internal thinking, I should pick the quickest method. Probably the decomposition: 10 + 2 times 7.\n\nNow, to present the answer. I need to state the result and briefly explain the thinking.\n\nThe user said \"show your internal thinking (brief)\", so I should keep it short.\n\nFinal answer is 84.\n\nInternal thinking: I'll say that I used the distributive property: 12 * 7 = (10 + 2) * 7 = 10*7 + 2*7 = 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nThat seems clear.\n\nI could mention the multiplication algorithm, but distributive property is fine.\n\nSince it's simple, I might just say: \"I know that 12 times 7 is 84 from basic multiplication facts, but I verified by adding 12 seven times or using distributive property.\"\n\nBut the user might want to see the reasoning, not just the memory.\n\nTo be thorough, I'll include a brief explanation.\n\nResponse structure:\n\n1. State the answer.\n\n2. Briefly explain the internal thought process.\n\nAnswer: 84\n\nInternal thinking: I calculated 12 * 7 by breaking it into (10 + 2) * 7 = 10*7 + 2*7 = 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nThat should suffice.",
