            "reasoning_content": "\nFirst, the user asked to solve 12 times 7 and show my internal thinking briefly. So, I need to multiply 12 by 7.\n\nI know that multiplication is repeated addition. So, 12 times 7 means adding 12 to itself 7 times. But that might be tedious, so I should use a more efficient method.\n\nI can break down 12 into 10 and 2. Then, multiply each part by 7 and add them together. That's the distributive property of multiplication over addition.\n\nSo, 10 times 7 is 70, and 2 times 7 is 14. Then, 70 plus 14 equals 84.\n\nI could also think of 12 times 7 as 7 times 12. 7 times 10 is 70, and 7 times 2 is 14, so 70 + 14 = 84.\n\nAnother way is to use multiplication tables. I remember that 12 times 5 is 60, and 12 times 2 is 24, so 60 plus 24 is 84. That also works.\n\nSince 7 is 7, and 12 is close to 10, but I think the first method is straightforward.\n\nLet me confirm with the standard multiplication algorithm.\n\nWrite it down:\n\n  12\n\nx  7\n\nFirst, multiply 7 by 2 (the units digit of 12), which is 14. Write down the 4, carry over the 1 to the tens place.\n\nThen, multiply 7 by 1 (the tens digit of 12), which is 7, plus the carry-over 1, so 7 + 1 = 8. Write down the 8.\n\nSo, it's 84.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSince 12 times 7, I know that 12 times 6 is 72, and 12 times 7 is one more 12, so 72 + 12 = 84. That's another way.\n\nBut I think the simplest is breaking it down into 10 and 2.\n\nNow, for the internal thinking, I need to show it briefly. So, I should state the key steps without too much detail.\n\nThe user said \"brief,\" so I'll keep it concise.\n\nFinal answer should be 84.\n\nLet me make sure: 12 × 7.\n\n10 × 7 = 70\n\n2 × 7 = 14\n\n70 + 14 = 84.\n\nYes.",
