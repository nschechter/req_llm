            "reasoning_content": "Got it, let's see. I need to solve 12 times 7. Hmm, how do I approach this? Well, multiplication is basically repeated addition, right? So 12 times 7 means adding 12 seven times. Let me try that: 12 + 12 is 24, plus another 12 is 36, then 48, 60, 72, 84. Wait, let me count again to make sure I didn't miss any. 1st 12, 2nd 24, 3rd 36, 4th 48, 5th 60, 6th 72, 7th 84. Yeah, that's seven additions. Alternatively, maybe breaking down 12 into 10 and 2. So 10 times 7 is 70, and 2 times 7 is 14. Then add those together: 70 + 14 = 84. That's quicker. Either way, the result should be 84. Let me check with another method. Maybe using the distributive property: 12 * 7 = (10 + 2) * 7 = 10*7 + 2*7 = 70 + 14 = 84. Yep, that works. I think that's solid. No mistakes there. So the answer is 84.",
