Greet the user in a friendly way.\n 2. Acknowledge their \"Hello world!\".\n 3. Offer assistance.\n\n We can write a response that says:\n   \"Hello! It's great to hear from you. How can I assist you today?\"\n\n But note: the user might be testing the system or just starting a conversation.\n\n Alternatively, we can be a bit more playful and say:\n   \"Hello, World! Welcome to the conversation. What can I help you with today?\"\n\n However, the classic \"Hello, World!\" is a programming tradition, so we can also make a reference to that.\n\n Let's choose a response that is friendly and open-ended.",
