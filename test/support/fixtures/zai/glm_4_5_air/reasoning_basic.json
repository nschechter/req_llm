            "reasoning_content": "First, the user asked to solve 12 times 7 and show my internal thinking briefly. So, I need to calculate 12 * 7 and explain how I'm doing it step by step, but keep it concise.\n\nI know that multiplication can be thought of as repeated addition. For example, 12 * 7 means adding 12 to itself 7 times. So, I can break it down: 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12.\n\nAdding those step by step: Start with 12 + 12 = 24. Then 24 + 12 = 36. Then 36 + 12 = 48. Then 48 + 12 = 60. Then 60 + 12 = 72. Finally, 72 + 12 = 84.\n\nSo, 12 * 7 = 84.\n\nI could also use the multiplication table. I know that 10 * 7 = 70, and 2 * 7 = 14. Then add those together: 70 + 14 = 84. That's another way to think about it.\n\nSince 12 is 10 + 2, I can use the distributive property: (10 + 2) * 7 = 10*7 + 2*7 = 70 + 14 = 84. Same result.\n\nI think showing one of these methods briefly would be good. The repeated addition might be straightforward, but the distributive property is efficient and clear.\n\nThe user said \"brief,\" so I should keep it short. Maybe one sentence for the method and then the answer.\n\nInternal thinking: I recall that 12 times 7 can be calculated by multiplying 10 by 7 to get 70, and 2 by 7 to get 14, then adding them to get 84.\n\nThen, the final answer is 84.\n\nI should present it in a boxed format as per the instruction, but since it's a multiplication, maybe just state it clearly.\n\nThe user said \"solve 12*7 and show your internal thinking (brief).\" So, I need to include both.\n\nPerhaps: Internal thinking: Multiply 12 by 7. I know 10*7=70 and 2*7=14, so 70+14=84.\n\nThen, Answer: 84.\n\nTo make it neat.",
